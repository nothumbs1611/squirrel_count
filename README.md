Simple script developed while learning python.  This script parses through a census that was taken of squirrels observed in central park in 2018, sorts them by color, counts the number of each color, and saves the results.

## Dependencies:
You must have python3 and pandas installed:
```

sudo apt install python3 pip3 pandas

```
